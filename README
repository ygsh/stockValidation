STOCKS VALIDATION TEST SUIT README
----------------------------------

1. Test suite uses Selenium, Maven and TestNG with PageObject patterns and PageFacotry locators.

2. After unzipping the project, to run the tests from command line, from the folder with pom.xml, please run below command:
    - mvn -e clean install test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml
    - Reports can be found under Project -> target -> surefire-reports -> index.html and emailable-report.html

3. To run as Maven tests from Eclipse IDE: 
	- Import the project as a maven project.
	- Set run configuration by right clicking on pom.xml and add argument "testng.xml" and hit run.
	- Reports can be found under Project -> target -> surefire-reports -> index.html and emailable-report.html
	
4. To run as a TestNG suite from Eclipse IDE:
	- Import the project as a maven project.
	- Install all dependencies by right clicking on pom.xml and performing maven install.
	- Right click on testng.xml and run as Test NG Suite.
	- Reports can be found under Project -> test-output ->index.html and emailable-report.html

5. Data is driven through textng.xml(Default browser is Firefox, but Chrome can be set as well)

6. Global parameters can be overridden at test level.

7. StocksWatch page is under src/main/java, tests using this page are created under src/test/java.

8. All tests extend TestSetup, base class takes care of driver initiation and closure.

9. Please note, current stocks page has issues with the percentage changes calculations. For example:
   (10.00/403.20) * 100 = 2.4813896. The server however stores this as 2.7. Possibly the calculation 
   are done in the backend with double digits for Opening stocks, Change in value and Change percent
   and then the results have been rounded off to two decimal places and uploaded.
   
   This bug is causing the test "ChangePercentValidationTest" to fail.
